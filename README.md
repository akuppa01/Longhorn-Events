# Longhorn-Events

***iOS App for customized viewing of events organized by UT Austin.***
- Utilized the SwiftSoup CocoaPods framework to web-scrape and store event options from the university events website within the app
- Provided a clean GUI of the events and details to allow users to filter based on factors like time, availability, & student org/department
- Connected the app to Google Calendar using their API to allow users to add event name, duration, & details to their calendars with ease
